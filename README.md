        In this project, I examine how children understand different science notions via some actions 
        which are tracked via the OpenPTrack system. To this end, the camera tracks the movement of kids
        in the space. These recorded activities were integrated into a computer emulation. The teacher 
        changes the background and other settings to inspire kids to play differently in the space. The 
        goal is to explore how and why augmented reality can generate modern horizons for learning. 
        
        For this purpose, I am interested in finding patterns of children movements via conducting 
        exploratory visual analysis of the students’ motion data to gain an understanding on how the
        technology can help kids.

    abstract: >
        Augmented reality emerged as a tool by which scientists attempt to develop many techniques to be used
        by educators. It provides many engaging learning moments and makes learning very attractive. The 
        significance of exploring the application of augmented reality in learning is because research shows
        that body movements assist students in grasping the material. In this project, we examine how children
        understand different science notions via some actions which are tracked via the OpenPTrack system. The
        camera tracks the movement of kids in an open space. These recorded activities were integrated into a
        computer emulation. The teacher changes the background on a screen at the front of the room to inspire
        kids to play differently in the space. The goal is to explore how and why augmented reality can generate
        modern horizons for learning. For this purpose, we are interested in finding patterns of children movements
        via conducting exploratory visual analysis of the studentsâ€™ motion data to gain an understanding on how
        the technology can help kids. 

    key question:
        Can embodied play activities help students learn scientific concepts like movement of particles in different settings
